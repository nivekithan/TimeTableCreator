# TimeTableCreator
**************** IMPORTANT if you are not student of UPES you wont be able to use this program************

This is what i am writting for weeks now, its been really good knowing that finally i am able to complete this and run the exactly the way i wanted it to.

Basically what it does is that logins to the collage website, gets the timetable, filters it to the data i need and store it in the excel file.

ROADMAP:

Considering that every class happens in online, my plane is to create another script which will read the data from excel and open the that paraticullar session in my browser
most likely that will take another week or so
